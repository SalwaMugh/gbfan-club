! This is ground control to major Tom, you've really made the grade
! And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
! Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
! This is major Tom to ground control, I'm stepping through the door
! And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
! And the stars look very different today
! Here am I sitting in a tin can far above the world
! Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do 
+ "Space Oddity"  
- David Bowie
